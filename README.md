### If you're not logged in...
+ I can't go to /list.
+ Cannot post with /create. 

## Fix points
1. I want to jump to the login screen after signup.
2. I would like to create a post button.

### Build Setup
```python
django-admin startproject projectname
```

### Start Server
```python
python manage.py runserver
```
